### abs()
 - Returns the absolute value of a number, the value may be an integer or a floating point number
 - Returns the distance in number from 0, e.g abs(100) and abs(-100) both return 100.  If the value passed is a complex number, its magnitude is returned.
 abs() can also take any custom object which has an implementation for __abs__()
 
```python
# simple abs
In [1]: abs(100)
Out[1]: 100

In [2]: abs(-100)
Out[2]: 100

# complex abs
In [4]: my_complex = 2+3j

In [5]: type(my_complex)
Out[5]: complex

In [6]: abs(my_complex)
Out[6]: 3.605551275463989

# floating abs
In [1]: abs(-100.252)
Out[1]: 100.252

# custom obj abs and __abs__
In [16]: class Custom:
    ...:     def __abs__(self):
    ...:         return 1000

In [17]: abs(Custom())
Out[17]: 1000

```
